Wordpress Plugin to load tachyons CSS Library

A simple plugin designed to enqueue the minified [tachyons](http://tachyons.io) library for making modular adjustments to your CSS.

I've really enjoyed using Tachyons because it allows me to focus on tweaking the styles applied to a particular element without having to worry about an every expanding stylesheet or making sure that I'm designing and naming classes in a way that's reusable. 

Tachyons allows you to focus on adding styles to an element by adding classes to it. Because tachyons classes are focused on doing only one thing, they are immensely more reusable than, say, Bootstrap classes. Using Bootstrap, I found myself making a lot of tweaks to the default styling so that everything didn't immediately look like Bootstrap.  It's easier to build your own reusable components by combining a series of classes that do exactly what you want them to in any given situation.

Anyway, this is an easy port to allow the use of the Tachyons CSS library within a Wordpress context. No shortcodes, just plain old CSS classes, to be referenced from within your HTML as usual.
